#### Polymorphisme par sous-typage

```
virtual devant fonction membre ->  méthode = sa résolution devient dynamique
```

Compilation : processing of source code files (.c or .cpp) and the creation of an 'object' file. This step doesn't create anything the user can actually run. 

Linking : Linking refers to the creation of a single executable file from multiple object files. In this step, it is common that the linker will complain about undefined functions. During compilation, if the compiler could not find the definition for a particular function, it would just assume that the function was defined in another file.
